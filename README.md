# yolo-onnx
The C++ code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/rakshith-2100/yolo-onnx/blob/main/yolo.cpp). I have used multiple sourses to write this code... there were multiple txt files that i also wanted to upload as the onnx file being a very large file wassn't able to upload all the files here.
